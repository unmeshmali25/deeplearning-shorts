Pipeline Overview

Name: rlhf-train-template
Purpose: Trains a language model using reinforcement learning based on human feedback
Platform: Runs on Google Cloud's Vertex AI

Main Components:
graph TD
    A[Reward Model Training] --> B[Reinforcement Learning]
    B --> C[Model Deployment]
    D[Evaluation] --> C

Key Pipeline Steps:
a) Reward Model Training
Takes human preference data (which response is better)
Trains a reward model to predict human preferences
Uses LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) for efficient training
b) Reinforcement Learning
Uses the trained reward model to guide model improvements
Optimizes the language model's responses
Balances between improving responses and staying close to original model behavior
c) Model Deployment (Optional)
Uploads the trained model to Vertex AI Model Registry
Can deploy to an endpoint for inference
d) Evaluation
Can run inference on an evaluation dataset
Helps assess model quality

Key Parameters:
training

This pipeline implements the RLHF technique (similar to what was used to train ChatGPT) on Google Cloud's infrastructure. It allows you to fine-tune language models based on human feedback about which responses are better.
